    This is a sample script to subscribe to messages from an MQTT broker at AWS. It then controls a Philips Hue LED.
    Whenever it receives a message, it queries the state of the Philips Hue LED. It then sends a message to the Philips
    Bridge and toggles the state of the LED.

    You have to register first at iotsky.io and create a new project.

    Then start the subscriber on one terminal and press the push button attached to the arduino yun.

    For more details visit iotsky.io

    Ensure that you have the paho mqtt client python lib and the phue library installed. You can find it here:
     https://pypi.python.org/pypi/paho-mqtt/1.1
     https://github.com/studioimaginaire/phue

   Alternatively you can install via pip:
       pip install paho-mqtt
       pip install phue
